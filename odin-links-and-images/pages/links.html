    <h1>Links</h1>
        <p>This example is about links and <a href="./images.html">images</a>.</p>

        <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

    <ul>
    <!-- Add <li> elements here -->
        <li>Absolute links, like to
        <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla
        Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web
        developers.</li>
        <li>Relative links, like to our <a href='./misc/extras.html'>extras
        page</a>.</li>
        <li>Root-relative links, linking from the root of ouer website, but we don't have our websites on a web server, so not useful to us right now. href would start with a forward slash (root). </li>
        
    </ul>
